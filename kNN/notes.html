    <p>The k-Nearest algorithm is a simple and effective way to classify data. It is an example of instance-based
        learning, where you need to have instances of data close at hand to perform the machine learning algorithm. The
        algorithm has to carry around the ful dataset; for large datasets, this implies a large amount of storage. In
        addition, you need to calculate the distance measurement for every piece of data in the database, and this can
        be cumbersome.\n
        An additional drawback is that kNN doesn't give you any idea of the underlying structure of the data; you have
        no idea what an "average" or "exemplar" instance from each class looks like.

        The kNN_handwriting.py script needs a testDigits and trainingDigits directory from the source code.
